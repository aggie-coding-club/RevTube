# RevTube

We plan on making a youtube clone that will incorporate both frontend and backend. The tech stack can be increased to further facilitate any ideas we may come up with as a team. Though I will lead the team, I still want to hear their ideas. For now html/css/js will be used for front in svelt and backend handled by firebase. This project will handle a lots of data in the backend and incorporate many UI functions.
